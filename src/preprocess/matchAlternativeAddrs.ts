/**
 * a “duplicate” = an “alternative address”, e.g. when
 * 12A and 1/12 refer to the same physical appartment,
 * but for whatever reason LINZ has duplicate entries.
 *
 * This didn't use to be a problem until LINZ rolled out
 * the new dataset which is full of nonsense entries.
 *
 * Contacted LINZ on 2023-02-07, they said they have
 * cancelled their plan to add a field to indiciate which
 * addresses are “alternate addresses” (i.e. duplicates).
 *
 * So we have to manually guess if an address is a duplicate.
 * A duplicate always has at least one 3xxx ID (i.e. from CADS).
 * For now, we only handle the case where we have:
 * 1/12, 2/12, 3/12 and 12A, 12B, 12C, for a 3-flat apartment.
